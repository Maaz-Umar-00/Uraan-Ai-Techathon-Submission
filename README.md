## üèõÔ∏è **Project Overview**

The **Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP)** funds hundreds of national projects every year across Pakistan.  
However, inefficiencies, missing progress tracking, and non-transparent fund flows lead to wastage and delays.  

Our project ‚Äî **PSDP Insight AI** ‚Äî analyzes, visualizes, and predicts PSDP project efficiency using **real government data**, empowering policymakers with actionable, data-driven transparency.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem & Solution**

**Problem:**  
Corruption, inefficient budget utilization, and non-transparent fund flows reduce accountability and project impact.  

**Solution:**  
We built a transparent, data-driven system that visualizes PSDP fund flows, highlights anomalies, and uses AI to predict project efficiency for early risk detection.

---

## üí° **Our Solution**

We manually extracted and verified **real PSDP 2024-25** data from official PDF reports using Python (`pdfplumber`).  
The dataset was authentic but inconsistent, requiring cleaning, feature engineering, and logic validation.

Then we developed two integrated modules:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **EDA Dashboard (Lovable App)**
Interactive analytical dashboard built in **Bolt/Lovable**, featuring:
- Five major data-driven charts.  
- Each chart includes **Interpretation + Recommendations**.  
- Summary metrics and statistical breakdown of PSDP 2024-25.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Baseline AI Model (Streamlit)**
An ML model that predicts if a project setup is *Efficient (1)* or *Inefficient (0)* based on key project metrics.

üìä **Example Inputs**
- Total Cost  
- Expenditure 2024  
- Allocation 2024-25  
- Throwforward 2025  
- Rupee Funding  
- Ministry  
- Project Type  
- Approval Year  

‚úÖ The model returns **‚ÄúEfficient‚Äù or ‚ÄúInefficient‚Äù** with a confidence percentage.

## üßÆ **Dataset**

- **File:** `PSDP_2024_25_verified.csv`  
- **Source:** Extracted from official PSDP 2024-25 reports.  
- **Size:** ~1 000 projects  
- **Columns:**  
  `Project_Title`, `Total_Cost`, `Expenditure_2024`, `Throwforward_2025`, `Allocation_2024_25`, `Ministry`, `Type`, `Utilization%`, `Approval_Year`, etc.

---

## üìä **Key EDA Charts + Insights**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Average Budget Utilization (%) by Ministry  
**Insight:** Ministries like *Law & Justice* and *Railways* exceed 150 % utilization, while others fall below 70 %.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Audit over-utilizing ministries.  
- Improve capacity in under-performing ones.  
- Implement quarterly performance reviews.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Budget Gap (Approved vs Actual Spending)  
**Insight:** Major under-spending observed in *Water Resources* and *Communication* Divisions.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Re-evaluate delayed projects.  
- Redirect surplus funds.  
- Establish transparent fund-tracking dashboards.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Budget Utilization by Project Type  
**Insight:** *Ongoing* projects average 139 % utilization; *New* projects only 10 %.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Strengthen feasibility before launching new projects.  
- Avoid multi-year carryovers.  
- Re-align funding to project maturity levels.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Funding Gap (Total Cost vs Annual Allocation)  
**Insight:** *Water Resources* and *National Heritage* ministries face > Rs 60 B funding shortfalls.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Break mega projects into annual phases.  
- Link allocations to milestone achievements.  
- Digitize cost vs allocation tracking.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Throwforward 2025 vs Allocation 2024-25  
**Insight:** Ratios exceeding 250 % show backlog stress for 2025.  
**Recommendations:**  
- Cap throwforward below 120 %.  
- Accelerate delayed projects.  
- Tie new allocations to verified physical progress.
